## 🚀 About the Project

With Apple's transition to its own silicon (M1, M2, M3...), preparing installation media for older Intel- and PowerPC-based computers has become a challenge. Many people encounter Terminal errors, issues with expired certificates in old installers, or simply a lack of compatibility with system tools.

**macUSB solves this problem.**

The application automates the entire process of creating a bootable USB drive. You don't need to search for commands online, worry about disk formatting, or manually fix validation errors in old installation files.

### What do you gain?
* **Legacy Support:** The ability to create installers for systems over a decade old (e.g., OS X Lion) directly on the latest Mac on Apple Silicon.
* **Time Saving:** The app detects the system version in the **`.dmg`**, **`.iso`**, **`.cdr`** or **`.app`** file, formats the drive, and copies files automatically.
* **Auto Fixes:** For certain systems (e.g., High Sierra/Mojave), the app automatically applies necessary fixes so the installer works despite expired Apple certificates.
* **PowerPC Revival:** The app formats USB drives to the Apple Partition Map (APM) scheme required by PowerPC Macs and transfers the installer directly from **`.iso`**, **`.cdr`** or **`.dmg`** files. This allows for installation without the need for physical CDs/DVDs or FireWire drives.

> **Fun Fact:** The application was created using the "Vibe Coding" method in collaboration with the Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 AI models. The project proves that programming barriers (even cross-architectural ones) can be overcome with determination and AI support.

## ⚠️ Installation and First Run

The application is an open-source project and does not possess a paid Apple Developer signature, so Gatekeeper will block it by default.

**How to run the app for the first time:**

1. Try to open the app - you will see an "Unknown Developer" message.
2. Go to **System Settings** -> **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section and click the **"Open Anyway"** button next to macUSB.
4. When writing the system to the flash drive, a system prompt asking for **access to removable volumes** will appear. You must **Allow** this so the application can format and write the system to the USB.

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Host Computer (where you run the app):
* **Processor:** Both Apple Silicon and Intel are supported.
* **System:** **macOS Sonoma 14.6** or newer.
* **Storage:** Minimum of **15 GB** of free disk space is required **to create the installers**.

### USB Drives & External Storage
* **Capacity:** A minimum of **16 GB** is required.
* **Speed:** USB 3.0 or newer is highly recommended for faster installation times.
* **External Drives (HDD/SSD):** By default, only USB flash drives are detected for safety. To use external disks, enable **Options** → **Enable external drives support**.

### Installation Files:
The program supports **`.dmg`**, **`.cdr`** and **`.iso`** disk images, as well as raw **`.app`** installer files.

> **Pro Tip:** Where to get valid files?
> * **OS X 10.7** and **10.10 – macOS 26:** The most convenient solution is downloading via the free app **[Mist](https://github.com/ninxsoft/Mist)**.
> * **OS X 10.9:** The recommended source is **[Mavericks Forever](https://mavericksforever.com/)** (macUSB support was developed based on the image from this site).
> * **Mac OS X 10.4 – 10.6 (Intel):** Disk images are available on the **Internet Archive**.
> * **Mac OS X 10.4 – 10.5 (PowerPC):** Images for PPC architecture can be found on **Macintosh Garden**.

[^1]: Only version **10.12.6** is supported.
[^2]: Tested on the image downloaded from [Mavericks Forever](https://mavericksforever.com/). Images from other sources have not been verified.
[^3]: Automatic detection supports only the **Single DVD** edition. Multi-disc editions might be unrecognized or misidentified (e.g., as "Read Before You Install"). In such cases, please use **Options** → **“Skip file analysis”** → **“Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 (Multi DVD)”** or press the keyboard shortcut **Command (⌘)** + **Option (⌥)** + **T**. <br>**Installation Tip:** When the installer requests the second disc (Disc 2), simply unplug the USB drive containing Disc 1 and insert the USB drive containing Disc 2. The **installer on the target Mac** will automatically detect the new volume and continue the installation.
